// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:
// https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress

describe('example to-do app', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Cypress starts out with a blank slate for each test
    // so we must tell it to visit our website with the `cy.visit()` command.
    // Since we want to visit the same URL at the start of all our tests,
    // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
    cy.visit('saas-admin.sit.powerbiz.asia')
  })

  

 
  

    it('can filter for completed tasks', () => {
      // We can perform similar steps as the test above to ensure
      // that only completed tasks are shown
      cy.contains('Completed').click()

      cy.get('.todo-list li')
        .should('have.length', 1)
        .first()

    it('can delete all completed tasks', () => {
      // First, let's click the "Clear completed" button
      // `contains` is actually serving two purposes here.
      // First, it's ensuring that the button exists within the dom.
      // This button only appears when at least one task is checked
      // so this command is implicitly verifying that it does exist.
      // Second, it selects the button so we can click it.
      cy.contains('Clear completed').click()

      // Then we can make sure that there is only one element
      // in the list and our element does not exist
      cy.get('.todo-list li')
        .should('have.length', 1)
        .should('not.have.text', 'Pay electric bill')

      // Finally, make sure that the clear button no longer exists.
      cy.contains('Clear completed').should('not.exist')
